# E-commerce Back End Starter Code




## !-- Setup -->

To use the application, you will need to clone the repo to your local machine, then run npm i to install all of the dependencies. You'll also need to add a .env file in the root directory that inclues DB_NAME='your-database-name', DB_USER='your-mysql-username', and DB_PW='your-mysql-password'.

You'll then need to set up the database by running mysql -u root -p followed by use your-database-name;. You can then leave the MySQL shell with quit;.

Finally, update the seed files in the seeds directory with your own data and seed the database with npm run seed. Once the application is set up, you can initiate it with npm start.
